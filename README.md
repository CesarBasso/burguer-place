This project simulates ordering from a burguer place. Developed with Node.js, Express and UUID library to generate client ID.

I worked with the routes:

- POST request: this is to create new orders

- GET request: this is to show all the orders placed

- PUT request: this is to update the orders

- DELETE request: this is to delete orders

- GET request: this is to show a specific order

- PATCH request: this is to upated the order status
